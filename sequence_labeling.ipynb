    "The longest sentences in the dataset seem to be speech transcriptions that are missing punctuation between sentences, so they are actually not single sentences, but paragraphs / collections of sentences. Therefore, these sentences can be considered mostly noise and might hurt the performance of the model. In comparison, the random sample of sentences from the dataset appears to be much closer to what one would expect. Including the longest \"sentences\" in the dataset for the purposes of training the model would increase the encoded size of each input sample substantially, since the vectorized form of each sample will be padded to the length of the maximum sentence, which would drastically increase computational load. For these reasons, we will truncate the longest sentences to 100 words, which is at the 99th percentile of sentence lengths."
